## **Stop Wasting Time on Repository Build-up!**

**Conqueror Repo Template** is a template repository designed for quickly
starting new projects with pre-configured tools and best development practices.
This template includes ready-made solutions for integration with **Git**,
**GitHub**, **CI/CD**, **Dependabot**, **TypeScript**, **Mocha**,
**Commitizen**, **Commitlint**, **Semantic Release**, **ESLint**, **Remark**,
**Welcome Bot**, **Auto Merge Bot**, **EditorConfig**, **Issue Templates**,
**Husky & Lint Staged** and **CodeQL**.

> [!TIP]
> This solution will work very well for teams
> as you can easily standardize projects with this template.

## Getting Started

1.  **Create a Repository:** Use this template
    to create a new repository on GitHub.

    > Since this is a **Public Template** you can click the button
    > `Use This Template` for a faster and more convenient cloning.

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone your new repository to your local machine.

1.  **Start Development:** Develop your project,
    making changes according to your project's needs.

1.  **Configure CI/CD:** Modify GitHub Actions
    settings to fit your CI/CD requirements.

## Benefits

> [!TIP]
> Also suitable for private repositories! Thanks to the well-tuned GitHub Actions
> your time will not be wasted, which means it will allow you to
> significantly reduce your costs.

## Features

-   **Flexibility:** Easily customizable template to adapt
    to different project types.

-   **Git and GitHub Integration:** Pre-configured `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
    and other files for efficient work with Git and GitHub.

-   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Built-in CI support using GitHub Actions
    for automatic building and testing of your code with each change.

-   **TypeScript:** Pre-configured TypeScript setup
    for improved reliability and development convenience.

-   **CodeQL:** Included CodeQL workflow for detecting
    and preventing potential vulnerabilities in your code.

-   **Linters:** Help you maintain a consistent code writing style
    and find errors.

-   **Conventional Commits, Commitlint & Commitizen:** If you don't want
    to think about how to write a commit every time,
    these plugins will help you.

    > It will be especially useful for teams that
    > have an ongoing debate about writing commits.

## JavaScript & TypeScript
